# Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Telecom Industry_Python_Project

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and handled null/missing values in the raw dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to analyze customer churn trends.

Demographic Insights: Breakdown of customer activity by gender, age group, and service usage patterns.

Trend Analysis: Monthly trends showing how many customers joined or left the service.

Actionable Insights: Helped identify key factors influencing churn and retention.
